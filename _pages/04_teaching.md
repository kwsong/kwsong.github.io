<b>Graduate Teaching Assistant - MAS.600: Human 2.0 (Spring 2014, MIT Media Lab)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Hugh Herr
<br>Description: This course covers principles underlying current and future technologies for cognitive, emotional and physical augmentation. Course focuses on using anatomical, biomechanical, neuromechanical, biochemical, and neurological models of the human body to guide the designs of augmentation technologies for persons with either unusual or normal physiologies that wish to extend their cognitive, emotional, social, or physical capability to new levels. Topics include robotic exoskeletons and powered orthoses, external limb prostheses, neural implant technology, social-emotional prostheses, and cognitive prostheses. The course requires student presentations, critiques of class readings, and a final project including a publication quality paper.

<b>Undergraduate Laboratory Assistant - ELE 208: Semiconductor Devices, ICs, and Micro-Fabrication (Spring 2011, Princeton University)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Stephen Chou
<br>This course examines what is inside a microchip, how it works, and how it is made. Topics include semiconductor material structures and properties, pn junction, solar cells, metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistors (MOSFET's), bipolar transistors, and their circuit applications such as digital gates and analog amplifiers, as well as microfabrication technology for semiconductor devices and integrated circuits, such as photolithography, etching, evaporation, and other thin film processing. The course has a hands-on integrated circuit microfabrication lab to fabricate diodes, MOSFET's and circuits by students themselves.

<b>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant - ELE 302: System Design and Analysis (Spring 2011, Princeton University)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Bradley Dickinson
<br>Comprehensive, laboratory-based course in electronic system design and analysis. Covers formal methods for the design and analysis of moderately complex real-world electronic systems. Course is centered around a semester-long design project involving a computer-controlled vehicle designed and constructed by teams of two students. Integrates microprocessors, communications, and control.

<h2>writing</h2>
<b>Instructor - SAT Essay Course (Fall 2018)</b>
<br>I developed and taught a remote mini-course for a class of 30 students in Singapore on how to write the SAT Essay and improve their ability to read and write argument.

<b>Princeton University Writing Center Fellow (Fall 2008 - Spring 2011)</b>
<br>I was one of ~50 undergraduate and graduate student fellows selected to work at the Writing Center. I held hour-long, one-on-one sessions (>50 conference hours per semester) with student working on writing assignments, dissertations, and oral presentations that varied in topic and discipline. I regularly took part in intensive training sessions and workshops with other Fellows.
