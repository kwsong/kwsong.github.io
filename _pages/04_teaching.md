<h2>technical courses</h2>
<b>Co-Instructor - CS 160: User Interface Design and Development (Summer 2023, UC Berkeley)</b>
<br>This upper-level undergraduate course is the CS department's introduction to HCI and UI design. It covers the user-centered design and analysis of graphical user interfaces through a combination of lectures and projects requiring students to work in teams to implement functional user interfaces for target tasks and evaluate their interfaces through user studies. For Summer 2023, CS 160's enrollment is capped at 60. As an Instructor of Record, I am responsible for delivering lectures as well as various logistical tasks including hiring, grading, updating the curriculum from previous years, and coordinating course logistics among 8 staff members.

<b>Instructor - Maker Launchpad Virtual/Augmented Reality Workshop (Summer 2022, UC Berkeley)</b>
<br>I was the instructor for a 2-week introductory workshop on VR/AR applications. I created and delivered an original curriculum on developing interactive applications in Unity and testing them on a head-mounted display.

<b>Graduate Student Instructor - DES INV 211: Designing Emerging Technologies I (Fall 2021, UC Berkeley)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Eric Paulos
<br>This is a Masters of Design studio-based course focusing on the design of interactive systems using emerging technologies, specifically voice recognition, augmented reality, and wearable technologies. I was the sole GSI for the inaugural MDes class of 21 students. I developed and led technical workshops for each module, held office hours to help troubleshoot projects, provided extensive verbal and written feedback during and after design critiques, and graded presentations and reading responses.

<b>Graduate Teaching Assistant - MAS.600: Human 2.0 (Spring 2014, MIT Media Lab)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Hugh Herr
<br>This is a graduate-level course covering principles underlying current and future technologies for human augmentation. The course involved a series of guest lectures on topics such as robotic exoskeletons and powered orthoses, external limb prostheses, neural implant technology, social-emotional prostheses, and cognitive prostheses. The course requires student presentations, critiques of class readings, and a final project. As one of 2 TAs, I was responsible for helping students develop and execute their final projects, as well as helping coordinate lectures and the grading of assignments.

<b>Undergraduate Laboratory Assistant - ELE 208: Semiconductor Devices, ICs, and Micro-Fabrication (Spring 2011, Princeton University)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Stephen Chou
<br>This undergraduate-level course covers the principles of semiconductor materials and devices through a mixture of lecture and a hands-on lab component, through which students fabricate and characterize their own microchip with components such as diodes, solar cells, MOSFETs, and ring oscillators. I served as a laboratory assistant to help students with physical disabilities execute the laboratory component of the course.

<b>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant - ELE 302: System Design and Analysis (Spring 2011, Princeton University)</b>
<br>Instructor: Professor Bradley Dickinson
<br>This undergraduate capstone course for electrical engineering majors covers formal methods for the design and analysis of complex real-world electronic systems integrating microprocessors, communications, and control. It is centered around the design of a miniature autonomous vehicle, in teams of two students, that follows a line on the ground, avoids obstacles, and also has a creative feature of the team's choice. As a TA, I held office hours in the departmental undergraduate lab to provide hands-on support and troubleshooting for teams throughout the semester.

<h2>writing</h2>
<b>Instructor - SAT Essay Course (Fall 2018)</b>
<br>I developed and taught a remote mini-course for a class of 30 students in Singapore on how to write the SAT Essay and improve their ability to read and write argument.

<b>Princeton University Writing Center Fellow (Fall 2008 - Spring 2011)</b>
<br>I was one of ~50 undergraduate and graduate student fellows selected to work at the Writing Center. I held hour-long, one-on-one sessions (>50 conference hours per semester) with student working on writing assignments, dissertations, and oral presentations that varied in topic and discipline. I regularly took part in intensive training sessions and workshops with other Fellows.
