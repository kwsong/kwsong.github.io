Starting in October 2024, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/io" target="_blank">TU Delft</a>. I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science @ UC Berkeley specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. My research centers around the creation of sustainable, backyard-degradable interactive systems that can be made and <i>un-made</i> at home by the everyday maker. My work embraces smart and natural materials, along with themes such as decay and slowness. Before entering Berkeley and the world of HCI, I was a hardware researcher and engineer, completing my undergraduate and master's theses in optoelectronic materials and devices and then working full-time as a Display Electrical Engineer at Apple.
