I'm a second year PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley specializing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I work with Professor Eric Paulos in the <a href="http://hybrid-ecologies.org" target="_blank">Hybrid Ecologies Lab</a>. I'm also part of the <a href="https://bid.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Institute of Design</a> and the <a href="http://bcnm.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Berkeley Center for New Media</a>.

Broadly speaking, lately I have been interested in developing tangible interfaces and digital fabrication workflows that embrace smart materials and the themes of destruction, "slowness," and sustainability. Before entering Berkeley and the world of HCI, I was branded as an electrical (hardware) engineer, with a research background in [opto]electronic materials and devices and a couple of years working as a Display Electrical Engineer at Apple. While I've started to swim in the pools of software tools, computer graphics, and computer vision, I remain fascinated by and passionate about incorporating new physical materials in my work.

I don't exist in any appreciable way on social media, but if you'd like to connect, please reach out to me via e-mail (kwsong [at] berkeley [dot] edu)!
