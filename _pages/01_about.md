I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science @ UC Berkeley specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. I work with Professor Eric Paulos in the <a href="http://www.hybrid-ecologies.org" target="_blank">Hybrid Ecologies Lab</a>. My research centers around the creation of sustainable, backyard-degradable interactive systems that can be made and <i>un-made</i> at home by the everyday maker. My work embraces smart and natural materials, along with themes such as decay and slowness. Before entering Berkeley and the world of HCI, I was a hardware researcher and engineer, completing my undergraduate and master's theses in optoelectronic materials and devices and then working full-time as a Display Electrical Engineer at Apple.
