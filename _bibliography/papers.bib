abstract = {Food and flavors are integral to our existence in the world. Nonetheless, taste remains an under-explored sense in interaction design. We present Füpop, a technical platform for delivering in-mouth flavors that leverages advances in electronics and molecular gastronomy. Füpop comprises a fully edible pouch placed inside the mouth against a cheek that programmatically releases different flavors when wirelessly triggered by a focused ultrasound transducer from outside the cheek. Füpop does not interfere with activities such as chewing and drinking, and its electronics may be integrated into devices already used near the cheek, such as mobile phones, audio headphones, and head-mounted displays. Füpop's flavors are from "real foods,"" not ones imitated with synthetic reagents, providing authentic, nutritive flavors. We envision that with Füpop, flavors may be synced to music, a phone call, or events in virtual reality to enhance a user's experience of their food and the world.},

abstract = {As sustainability becomes an increasingly pressing concern across disciplines, the design and fabrication communities within HCI are rapidly discovering and sharing a wealth of novel materials, tools, and workflows, allowing us to make physical artifacts that are more eco-friendly than ever before. Still, sustainability and functionality are often at odds with one another when it comes to the design of interactive systems, with most systems still relying on conventional electronic components that must be extracted and individually handled at end of life. My work offers approaches for designing decomposable interactive systems that are made with materials that are widely available, safe, and even edible, empowering the “everyday designer” to make sustainable systems for applications that do not demand long operation times or high power. Enabled by the growing ecosystem of decomposable materials and systems, I also propose new opportunities for designing for unmaking, a counterpart to making that opens the opaque, industrial processes of recycling and composting as rich design spaces to encourage further engagement and critical reflection around themes of sustainability, materiality, and consumption.},

We characterize different fabrication techniques and lotions to demonstrate various visual effects on a variety of skin types and tones.

abstract = {Providing electrical power is essential for nearly all interactive technologies, yet it often remains an afterthought. Some designs handwave power altogether as an “exercise for later.” Others hastily string together batteries to meet the system’s electrical requirements, enclosing them in whatever box fits. Vim is a new approach – it elevates power as a first-class design element; it frees power from being a series of discrete elements, instead catering to exact requirements; it enables power to take on new, flexible forms; it is fabricated using low-cost, accessible materials and technologies; finally, it advances sustainability by being rechargeable, non-toxic, edible, and compostable. Vims are decomposable battery alternatives that rapidly charge and can power small applications for hours. We present Vims, detail their characteristics, offer design guidelines for their fabrication, and explore their use in applications spanning prototyping, fashion, and food, including novel systems that are entirely decomposable and edible.},

We detail its design and present a series of use cases, from enabling a novel resealable packaging system to acting as a catalyst for shape-changing designs and beyond.

Researchers and designers have recently started to explore the concept of “unmaking” to actively think about important design issues like reuse, repair, and unintended socio-ecological impacts. They have also observed the importance of unmaking as a ubiquitous process in the world, and its relation to making in an ongoing dialectic that continually recreates our material and technological realms. Despite the increasing attention to unmaking, it remains largely under-investigated and under-theorized in HCI. The objectives of this workshop are therefore to (a) bring together a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in exploring or showcasing the affordances of unmaking, (b) articulate the material and epistemological scopes of unmaking within HCI, and (c) reflect on frameworks, research approaches, and technical infrastructure for unmaking in HCI that can support its wider application in the field.},

As a follow-up to the 2022 Unmaking@CHI workshop, this workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners interested in unmaking as it relates to sustainability and will focus primarily on exploring the role of unmaking in material practices, drawing upon the growing body of unmaking theory to explore future research opportunities for designing physical things with sustainable materials that are transient, degradable, and intentionally unmake-able. In addition to considering the pragmatics of what and how to unmake, we seek to articulate the relationships among unmaking and other related emerging themes and sustainable material practices -- including biodegradation, designing with more-than-human agencies, reuse, and repair -- and propose guidelines for designing for the unmaking of physical artifacts that are sustainable, equitable, and respectful of all entities involved.},

However, the focus is often on the resulting static artifact or the creative process and tools to design it. We envision a post-making process that extends past these final static objects – not just in their making but in their ``unmaking.''  By drawing from artistic movements such as Auto-Destructive Art, intentionally inverting well-established engineering principles of structurally sound designs, and safely misusing unstable materials, we demonstrate an important extension to making – unmaking.  In this paper, we provide designers with a new vocabulary of unmaking operations within standard 3D modeling tools. We demonstrate how such designs can be realized using a novel multi-material 3D printing process. Finally, we detail how unmaking allows designs to change over time, is an ally to sustainability and re-usability, and captures themes of "aura," emotionality, and personalization.},

The dispersive nature of the electronic transport is directly related to the band tail density of states distribution. The technique is extended to measure the band tail DOS over a range of energies. In each type of cell we observe an approximately exponential band tail, but also find an additional broad distribution of deep states. Measurements of the photocurrent spectral response to low energy provide an alternative measure of the optical absorption spectrum for excitations from the polymer HOMO to the PCBM LUMO. These data also reveal an exponential distribution of band tail states with a slope that is the same as the electron transport measurements.},

Individual TFTs on a 50µm-thick polyimide foil were bent to known radii, and measurement of transfer characteristics were made both during strain and after re-flattening. Compared with conventional TFTs made with SiNx, TFTs made with the new hybrid material demonstrated similar flexibility when strained in compression and significantly increased flexibility when strained in tension. Under bending to compressive strain, all TFTs tested delaminated from the substrate for compressive strains greater than 2\%. Conventional a-Si:H/SiNx TFTs have been previously found to delaminate at a similar compressive strain. Under bending to tensile strain, the most flexible TFTs made with the new hybrid material that were tested after re-flattening did not exhibit significant changes in transfer characteristics up to strains of 2.5\%. Conventional aSi:H/SiNx TFTs have been found to remain functional for strains of up to 0.5\%, a value only one-fifth of that for TFTs made with the new hybrid material.},

 abstract = {Advancements in robotic technologies have enabled a significant improvement in the clinical efficacy of prosthetic limbs for persons with upper and lower-extremity amputations. However, significant challenges still remain in establishing a biomimetic bidirectional neural communication between amputees and their external powered prostheses. Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces may offer a high-resolution alternative to conventional nerve interface technologies for their unique potential to provide increased biospatial resolution for both the control of and feedback from an external powered prosthesis. Here, we present three separate design for 3-D microchannel arrays, each having 16-20 channels measuring 200 μm by 200 μm: one passive (without integrated electrodes), one active (with integrated electrodes), and one active with a porous collagen scaffold. With the array positioned between proximal and distal nerve sendings, we evaluate their effectiveness in tibial n. regeneration in vivo in both rats (N=4) and ferrets (N=4). Using immunofluorescence, we report robust mixed sensory and motor nerve regeneration through the microchannels in all rats, and weak regeneration in 2 of 4 ferrets, suggesting both interspecies regeneration variability and the lack of benefit of axially oriented collagen in improving ferret nerve regeneration through microchannels.},

 abstract = {Quantum dot light emitting devices (QD-LEDs) are promising options for the next generation of solid state lighting, color displays, and other optoelectronic applications. Overcoating quantum dots (QDs) – semiconducting nanocrystals of CdSe, PbS, or another similar compound – with a wide band-gap "shell" has recently been shown to significantly boost QD-LED performance and yield the most efficient QD-LEDs to date. This thesis studies fabrication techniques to make bright, efficient QD-LEDs with these "core-shell" QDs. The first part studies the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of CdSe/ZnS QDs. QD-LEDs conventionally utilize a QD film that is deposited via spin-casting, a reliable but highly unscalable technique for the deposition of thin, smooth films of QDs for QD-LED applications. Potential advantages of EPD include the ability for deposition onto a variety of substrate shapes and more energetically favorable QD packing. Devices made with EPD QD films exhibit peak efficiencies comparable to those of devices with a spun-cast QD layer and turn-on voltages surprisingly lower than the optical band-gap of the QDs. These results suggest that EPD is a viable alternative to spin-casting for the processing of QD-LEDs. The second part of this thesis explores the role of core-shell QDs in creating bright, efficient LEDs in the near-infrared (λ > 1 µm) regime. Infrared QD-LEDs with record brightness and efficiencies are obtained by using QDs in which lead sulfide (PbS) cores are overcoated with a cadmium sulfide (CdS) shell. In situ photoluminescence quantum yield measurements confirm that the QD shell plays a significant role in shielding the emissive QD core from external quenching mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells are reported. The photoconductivity spectral response of the solar cells has a weak absorption band extending from the band-gap energy down to <1 eV due to charge-transfer optical excitation at the interface between the polymer and the fullerene. The low-energy absorption indicates an exponential band tail of localized states and an absorption model based on the one-electron joint density of electronic states accounts for the data. Transient photoconductivity measurements of the carrier mobility exhibit a temperature-dependent carrier dispersion. Data analysis for the particular case of transport in the BHJ structure is developed. A multiple trapping model of the dispersive transport is consistent with localized band tail states having a comparable density-of-states distribution to those observed by optical absorption. Theoretical calculations of the density of states including disorder in the π-π spacing of the polymer chains also shows exponential band tailing. A density-of-states model is developed from the data and is discussed.}

To achieve this, we present a sensing sheet that combines high-performance ICs with flexible electronics, allowing bonding to such surfaces. The flexi­ ble electronics integrates thin-film strain gauges and amorphous­ silicon control circuits, patterned on a polyimide sheet that can potentially span large areas. Non-contact links couple digital and analog signals to the ICs, allowing many ICs to be intro­ duced via low-cost sheet lamination for energy-efficient readout and computation over a large number of sensors. Communi­ cation between distributed ICs is achieved by transceivers that exploit low-loss interconnects patterned on the polyimide sheet; the transceivers self-calibrate to the interconnect impedance to maximize transmit SNR. The system achieves multi-channel strain readout with sensitivity of 18J1'strainRMs at an energy per measurement of 270nJ, while the communication energy is 12.8pJ/3.3pJ per bit (Tx/Rx) over 7.5m.},

 abstract = {The mainstream commercialization of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) for light-emitting applications has begun: Sony televisions emitting QD-enhanced colors are now on sale. The bright and uniquely size-tunable colors of solution-processable semiconducting QDs highlight the potential of electroluminescent QD light-emitting devices (QLEDs) for use in energy-efficient, high-color-quality thin-film display and solid-state lighting applications. Indeed, this year’s report of record-efficiency electrically driven QLEDs rivaling the most efficient molecular organic LEDs, together with the emergence of full-color QLED displays, foreshadow QD technologies that will transcend the optically excited QD-enhanced products already available. In this article, we discuss the key advantages of using QDs as luminophores in LEDs and outline the 19-year evolution of four types of QLEDs that have seen efficiencies rise from less than 0.01\% to 18\%. With an emphasis on the latest advances, we identify the key scientific and technological challenges facing the commercialization of QLEDs. A quantitative analysis, based on published small-scale synthetic procedures, allows us to estimate the material costs of QDs typical in light-emitting applications when produced in large quantities and to assess their commercial viability.},

@thesis{song_largearea_2011,
 title = {Large Area Circuits for a Hybrid Macroelectronics-Nanoelectronics Active Monitoring System},
 copyright = {All rights reserved},
 abstract = {Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin film transistors (TFTs) are critical components for large area electronics, such as displays and sensors, but up until now, their applications in flexible electronics technology has been limited by their low degree of flexibility. Conventional a-Si:H TFTs are made with a stiff, brittle silicon nitride (SiNx) gate dielectric that restricts the overall flexibility of the devices. Recently, a new, compliant SiO2-silicone hybrid material was invented to replace the conventional SiNx in TFTs. This “hybrid” was found to possess the electrical impermeability characteristic of an inorganic SiO2 dielectric as well as the flexibility characteristic of the polymeric silicone. In the first part of this thesis, we describe studies on the flexibility of TFTs made with the new gate dielectric. We find that the replacement of the SiNx gate dielectric in a-Si:H TFTs with the SiO2-silicone hybrid material results in up to a ten fold increase in flexibility.

The development of these ultra-flexible a-Si:H TFTs opens the path to new domains for electronics. In addition to being used in flexible displays, flexible a-Si:H TFTs have the potential to be implemented in new environments that are traditionally off limits to conventional electronics. Here, we describe one such application. The target application of our particular system is for structural health monitoring (SHM) of infrastructure, but it may ideally be applied to systems in other environments as well. a-Si:H TFT based large area circuits are combined with nanoscale integrated circuit (IC) chips to form a system that is both computationally efficient and scalable. The second part of this thesis focuses on a “scanning circuit” composed of a-Si:H TFTs that serves as the interface between a nanoscale IC chip and an array of large area sensors. It is designed to accommodate the low power requirements of the system and account for the imbalance between n-channel and p-channel performance in a-Si:H TFTs. The circuit is initially simulated using standard 90nm Generic Process Design Kit models, and once the functionality is confirmed, a TFT model for simulation is created by empirically fitting a SPICE Level 1 MOSFET model to measured TFT output characteristics. Circuit simulations run with this TFT model demonstrate that the scanning circuit is a feasible design in theory. Preliminary experiments on a single scanning block indicate that the circuit can operate at frequencies of 2.5 kHz, which is sufficient for the target frequency of ∼ 1 kHz.},
