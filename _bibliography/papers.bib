 abstract = {The access and growing ubiquity of digital fabrication has ushered in a celebration of creativity and "making."  However, the focus is often on the resulting static artifact or the creative process and tools to design it. We envision a post-making process that extends past these final static objects – not just in their making but in their ``unmaking.''  By drawing from artistic movements such as Auto-Destructive Art, intentionally inverting well-established engineering principles of structurally sound designs, and safely misusing unstable materials, we demonstrate an important extension to making – unmaking.  In this paper, we provide designers with a new vocabulary of unmaking operations within standard 3D modeling tools. We demonstrate how such designs can be realized using a novel multi-material 3D printing process. Finally, we detail how unmaking allows designs to change over time, is an ally to sustainability and re-usability, and captures themes of "aura," emotionality, and personalization.},

 abstract = {Passively consuming digital social media content often precludes users from mindfully considering the value they derive from such experiences as they engage in them. We present a system for using Twitter that requires users to continuously turn a hand crank to power their social media screen. We evaluate the device and its effects on how users value Twitter with 3 participants over 3 weeks, with the middle week of Twitter usage directed exclusively through our system. Using our device caused a dramatic decrease in Twitter usage for all participants, which either persisted or rebounded in the post-intervention week. Our analysis of diary studies and qualitative interviews surfaced three themes indicating shifting focus on content, shifting awareness about the role of social media, and new social dynamics around content-sharing.},

 abstract = {The stiff SiNx gate dielectric in conventional amorphous silicon thin film transistors (TFTs) limits their flexibility by brittle fracture when in tension. We report the effect on the overall flexibility of TFTs of replacing the brittle SiNx gate dielectric with a new, resilient SiO2-silicone hybrid material, which is deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. Individual TFTs on a 50µm-thick polyimide foil were bent to known radii, and measurement of transfer characteristics were made both during strain and after re-flattening. Compared with conventional TFTs made with SiNx, TFTs made with the new hybrid material demonstrated similar flexibility when strained in compression and significantly increased flexibility when strained in tension. Under bending to compressive strain, all TFTs tested delaminated from the substrate for compressive strains greater than 2\%. Conventional a-Si:H/SiNx TFTs have been previously found to delaminate at a similar compressive strain. Under bending to tensile strain, the most flexible TFTs made with the new hybrid material that were tested after re-flattening did not exhibit significant changes in transfer characteristics up to strains of {\textasciitilde}2.5\%. Conventional aSi:H/SiNx TFTs have been found to remain functional for strains of up to 0.5\%, a value only one-fifth of that for TFTs made with the new hybrid material.},

The transient photoconductivity experiment measures the electron and hole drift mobility in the solar cells. The dispersive nature of the electronic transport is directly related to the band tail density of states distribution. The technique is extended to measure the band tail DOS over a range of energies. In each type of cell we observe an approximately exponential band tail, but also find an additional broad distribution of deep states. Measurements of the photocurrent spectral response to low energy provide an alternative measure of the optical absorption spectrum for excitations from the polymer HOMO to the PCBM LUMO. These data also reveal an exponential distribution of band tail states with a slope that is the same as the electron transport measurements.},

 abstract = {Experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells are reported. The photoconductivity spectral response of the solar cells has a weak absorption band extending from the band-gap energy down to <1 eV due to charge-transfer optical excitation at the interface between the polymer and the fullerene. The low-energy absorption indicates an exponential band tail of localized states and an absorption model based on the one-electron joint density of electronic states accounts for the data. Transient photoconductivity measurements of the carrier mobility exhibit a temperature-dependent carrier dispersion. Data analysis for the particular case of transport in the BHJ structure is developed. A multiple trapping model of the dispersive transport is consistent with localized band tail states having a comparable density-of-states distribution to those observed by optical absorption. Theoretical calculations of the density of states including disorder in the π-π spacing of the polymer chains also shows exponential band tailing. A density-of-states model is developed from the data and is discussed.}

Non-contact links couple digital and analog signals to the ICs, allowing many ICs to be intro­ duced via low-cost sheet lamination for energy-efficient readout and computation over a large number of sensors. Communi­ cation between distributed ICs is achieved by transceivers that exploit low-loss interconnects patterned on the polyimide sheet; the transceivers self-calibrate to the interconnect impedance to maximize transmit SNR. The system achieves multi-channel strain readout with sensitivity of 18J1'strainRMs at an energy per measurement of 270nJ, while the communication energy is 12.8pJ/3.3pJ per bit (Tx/Rx) over 7.5m.},

Indeed, this year’s report of record-efficiency electrically driven QLEDs rivaling the most efficient molecular organic LEDs, together with the emergence of full-color QLED displays, foreshadow QD technologies that will transcend the optically excited QD-enhanced products already available. In this article, we discuss the key advantages of using QDs as luminophores in LEDs and outline the 19-year evolution of four types of QLEDs that have seen efficiencies rise from less than 0.01\% to 18\%. With an emphasis on the latest advances, we identify the key scientific and technological challenges facing the commercialization of QLEDs. A quantitative analysis, based on published small-scale synthetic procedures, allows us to estimate the material costs of QDs typical in light-emitting applications when produced in large quantities and to assess their commercial viability.},

Regenerative peripheral nerve interfaces may offer a high-resolution alternative to conventional nerve interface technologies for their unique potential to provide increased biospatial resolution for both the control of and feedback from an external powered prosthesis. Here, we present three separate design for 3-D microchannel arrays, each having 16-20 channels measuring 200 μm by 200 μm: one passive (without integrated electrodes), one active (with integrated electrodes), and one active with a porous collagen scaffold. With the array positioned between proximal and distal nerve sendings, we evaluate their effectiveness in tibial n. regeneration in vivo in both rats (N=4) and ferrets (N=4). Using immunofluorescence, we report robust mixed sensory and motor nerve regeneration through the microchannels in all rats, and weak regeneration in 2 of 4 ferrets, suggesting both interspecies regeneration variability and the lack of benefit of axially oriented collagen in improving ferret nerve regeneration through microchannels.},

 abstract = {Quantum dot light emitting devices (QD-LEDs) are promising options for the next generation of solid state lighting, color displays, and other optoelectronic applications. Overcoating quantum dots (QDs) – semiconducting nanocrystals of CdSe, PbS, or another similar compound – with a wide band-gap "shell" has recently been shown to significantly boost QD-LED performance and yield the most efficient QD-LEDs to date. This thesis studies fabrication techniques to make bright, efficient QD-LEDs with these "core-shell" QDs. The first part studies the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of CdSe/ZnS QDs. QD-LEDs conventionally utilize a QD film that is deposited via spin-casting, a reliable but highly unscalable technique for the deposition of thin, smooth films of QDs for QD-LED applications. Potential advantages of EPD include the ability for deposition onto a variety of substrate shapes and more energetically favorable QD packing. Devices made with EPD QD films exhibit peak efficiencies comparable to those of devices with a spun-cast QD layer and turn-on voltages surprisingly lower than the optical band-gap of the QDs. These results suggest that EPD is a viable alternative to spin-casting for the processing of QD-LEDs. The second part of this thesis explores the role of core-shell QDs in creating bright, efficient LEDs in the near-infrared (λ {\textgreater}1 µm) regime. Infrared QD-LEDs with record brightness and efficiencies are obtained by using QDs in which lead sulfide (PbS) cores are overcoated with a cadmium sulfide (CdS) shell. In situ photoluminescence quantum yield measurements confirm that the QD shell plays a significant role in shielding the emissive QD core from external quenching mechanisms.},

 abstract = {At least partial function of a human limb is restored by surgically removing at least a portion of an injured or diseased human limb from a surgical site of an individual and transplanting a selected muscle into the remaining biological body of the individual, followed by contacting the transplanted selected muscle, or an associated nerve, with an electrode, to thereby control a device, such as a prosthetic limb, linked to the electrode. Simulating proprioceptive sensory feedback from a device includes mechanically linking at least one pair of agonist and antagonist muscles, wherein a nerve innervates each muscle, and supporting each pair with a support, whereby contraction of the agonist muscle of each pair will cause extension of the paired antagonist muscle. An electrode is implanted in a muscle of each pair and electrically connected to a motor controller of the device, thereby simulating proprioceptive sensory feedback from the device.}

 abstract = {A display device may include a display having a pixels and a processor. The processor may receive image data, determine a digital offset value for a pixel based on a location of the pixel, such that the digital offset value compensates for one or more non-uniformity properties of the pixel. The processor may determine a scale factor associated with the pixel based on at least two of a luminance setting for the display, a driving mode of the display, and a gray level value for the pixel. The processor may then generate correction image data by applying the scale factor to the digital offset value, generate compensated image data based on the correction image data and the image data, and provide the compensated image data to the display.}
