Here is a snapshot of some thing I do or did "for fun." Consider this an abbreviated brain dump that contains some resources you might find useful, some opinions that you might have counter-opinions regarding, and some musings that I'd welcome your suggestions and thoughts on. All photos either taken with my trusty Sony a6000 mirrorless camera or less trusty old iPhone.

<h2>climbing</h2>
<!--I first started climbing in 2012 in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. I'm partial to trad routes in theory but spend more time on shorter 1-3 pitch routes in practice. I am not a guide or professional, but I've provided a few of my thoughts regarding places to go if you're based in Berkeley and gear that I lug around.

Places to climb in/near Berkeley:
The climbing within 1 hour of Berkeley is mediocre at best in my opinion, but there are spots that make for decent half-day outings, especially if you'd just like to set up a top rope. Some of the options include:
<ul>
<li>Cragmont Park (Berkeley)</li> I wouldn't recommend trying to lead anything here, but there are a couple of surprisingly good, albeit short, top ropes. Note that this park has been closed since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
<li>Mount Diablo (near Walnut Creek)</li> Mediocre climbing, but it's climbing. XXXX is a must-do if you're set on checking out the area. Most of the other climbs I have done have had short fun sections interspersed with nearly impossible blank faces. Popular.
<li>Ring Mountain (Marin)</li> Comically short routes that are top-rope only and might be tricky to rig an anchor for without a lot of long slings, but the moves are surprisingly fun.
<li>Mt St Helena (Napa)</li> I have not been since the wildfires wiped out a lot of the popular climbing areas, but the 2 times I went I remember being pleasantly surprised. A few decent sport lines.
<li>Castle Rock (South Bay)</li> There are some not-bad climbs here, but it is insanely popular with both climbers and hikers. Some would disagree, but I have never been on a line that was worth leading. The bouldering is better, but I'm not much of a boulderer.
</ul>

If you're willing to drive for a couple of hours, there is fantastic climbing in the Tahoe area and eastern California. Some of my favorite places are listed below. I appreciate high-quality rock climbing, but I loathe crowds and lines, so mileage may vary, depending on how your personal preferences align with mine:
<ul>
<li>Lover's Leap</li> This is actually one of the most popular areas in Northern California, but the routes are so good that it's still one of my favorite places. The crowds aren't an issue if you're up for climbing whatever is open, but the mega-classics (particularly those in the 5.7-5.9 range) almost always have lines. I last tried to visit in July 2020, but there were so many cars in the parking lot that we decided to go to Phantom Spires, which was totally empty, instead.
<li>Phantom Spires</li> There is free camping, and it has never been crowded when I've been there. Candyland is a route not to be missed! Driving down the trail to the parking lot is a bit dicey without a high-clearance vehicle, but the walk from the main road is only ~15 minutes anyway, and there are intermediate lots that you can pull into in case you want to bail (like I have pretty much every time I've gone). The sport climbing that I've done here is very sandbagged (i.e. harder than you'd expect for the grade), but the trad climbing is actually pretty good.
<li>Donner</li> Again, a fairly popular area, but there are a lot of high-quality crags, so there's usually somewhere you can go.
<li>Emeralds</li> Surprisingly decent sport climbing for Northern California.
<li>Tuolomne Meadows</li> Far less crowded than Yosemite Valley (though ~1-1.5 hours of more driving). Possibly my favorite area ever, though it's a haul from the Bay.
<li>Yosemite Valley</li> This one gets enough attention without me speaking to it.
</ul>

Outside of Northern California, I have also climbed to varying extents in Joshua Tree, Bishop, New Hampshire, the Gunks, the Adirondacks, Smith Rock, Red Rocks, Moab, Squamish, and El Chorro (Andalucia in Spain). If you're interested in info regarding those (and possibly guidebooks), feel free to reach out.

Below is a summary of the climbing gear I own/carry:
<ul>
<li>Helmet</li> I never climb without a helmet and recommend never climbing or belaying without one. Unless you are super strapped for cash, get yourself a nice, lightweight helmet like the Petzl Sirocco or Black Diamond Vapor Helmet so that wearing one won't be a miserable experience like it was for me for my first 7 years of climbing, during which I wore the cheapest thing I could get.
<li>Harness</li> I currently use the Black Diamond Solution Guide harness. I have very few opinions about harnesses.
<li>Shoes</li> I wear La Sportiva Solutions for sport climbing and La Sportiva TC Pros for longer days. The sizes have long rubbed off, but I can barely fit my feet into the Solutions, and TC Pros are just comfy enough that I can leave them on all day and not want to cry. Despite the Internet's advice, I wait too long to resole my shoes (when I start to see that I've completely worn the rand through in a spot) and have already done so twice for each pair. I haven't noticed the effects of my delinquency yet, but maybe I just don't climb hard enough to notice...
<li>Belay device</li> - After about 5 years of using an ATC guide, I now use a Grigri when I can. I still like the feel of belaying with an ATC, but I acknowledge the added safety of a Grigri or similar locking device. I liked the Mega Jul for its functionality and minimalism while I had one (long story), but it isn't quite as smooth of an experience. Because I'm paranoid, I also carry a Camp Ovo belay plate when I'm multi-pitch climbing in case I drop my belay device (you can belay with a munter hitch, but it is not pleasant).
<li>Cams</li> - I carry Black Diamond Camalot C4s and X4s (doubles 0.1-4 + a single #5), Metolius Master Cams, and Totem/Fixie Aliens. I really like aliens, though I don't really know why. I've also enjoyed using Wild Country Friends, but really, you can't go wrong with cams from one of the major brands. If you're building a new rack, check out the new Black Diamond ultralight cams, because the weight of cams can really add up.
<li>Nuts</li> - I am partial to DMM offset nuts and DMM Wallnuts. Do your future self a favor and also carry Micro Wallnuts - they are lightweight, and I've needed them for psychological sanity more than once.
<li>Alpine draws</li> I make these myself with single-length dyneema slings and 2 carabiners (I can't remember which I use, but I'm not picky when it comes to carabiners and slings). I extend pretty much every piece I place unless I am particularly frightful of falling any extra amount more than I have to, so I tend to bring a lot of these - 6-8.
<li>Carabiners</li> I really have no opinion here, but maybe it's because I started with the cheapest and heaviest carabiners on the market, so things have only gone up from there for me.
<li>Sport draws</li> - A few months ago, I picked up a few sets of Petzl Djinn Axess quickdraws on a discount to replace my past Omega Pacific Dash Dirtbag draws ("the cheapest and heaviest"), which were some of my first climbing purchases ever. I now lead a luxurious life with unbelievably smooth clips.
<li>Approach shoes</li> I have worn multiple pairs of Evolv Cruzers until the soles fell off. I love everything about them besides the narrow toebox, but these "shoes" are not for everyone. I also do have plantar fasciitis that may or may not be related to my choices, so...
<li>Rope</li> Get a rope that's UIAA rated. Other than that, I don't have too much of an opinion. A 9.7mm 70m rope suits the majority of my pursuits well.

<h2>mountains</h2>
One of my favorite things to do is to spend time in/near mountains through rock climbing, mountaineering (yes, that's a word), trail running, and hiking.

<!--<h2>trail running</h2>
Since my illustrious career as a sprinter on my middle school track team (100% sarcasm), I've been very casually running on and off for years. In the fall of 2019, I discovered the trails of Berkeley and totally fell in love with trail running, and Scott Jurek's <em>Eat and Run</em> inspired me to sign up for my first race. A beet experiment gone wrong aside, it was a total blast, and I'm intrigued to try to run even longer distances once we can return to some degree of normalcy. I don't currently follow a specific training plan - I "run easy" most of the time and allow a few weeks a year when other pursuits or life happenings take priority; that may change, but that's the way it is for now. Some of the trails I like to frequent in Berkeley include:
<ul>
<li>Berkeley fire trails</li> - with the exception of a ~0.1 mi-long, very steep hill, the fire trail is one of the most runnable and accessible trails from Berkeley. It's ~20 feet wide, so even though it's popular, you can easily keep your distance from other people.
<li>Stonewall Panoramic Trail</li> - I've "run" this trail a handful of times, and every single time it's felt extremely hard. The top half of this ~1 mile trail is unshaded and dusty in the summer, which amps up the experience...
<li>Marin</li> - You really can't go wrong with pretty much any trail in Marin, though I did once almost get run over by a mountain biker.
</ul>

Gear:
<ul>
<li>Shoes</li> I have a weird fascination with shoes (and the fact that we still haven't solved this problem?). I am extremely partial to Altra shoes, particularly the Superior line for trails and Escalante for roads. Once I experienced a wide toe box I couldn't go back. Other shoes I've tried include the Saucony Kinvara (never again for me), the Hoka One One Torrent (neutral), and a variety of minimalist shoes/sandals. I ran almost exclusively in minimalist shoes between 2012 and 2019 (sandals during the entirety of 2018), but my feet started getting fed up with my choices, especially as I started running more on trails. I spent a few years of my life studying and thinking about biomechanics a lot, but the only conclusion I have regarding shoes is whatever is most comfortable and hurts less is best?
<li>Socks</li> Except for a period when I was actively trying to fix my running form, I don't usually get blisters or lose toenails (maybe stuffing my feet into climbing shoes has toughened them?), so I'm not too picky about socks. That being said, I have a few pairs of Injinji toe socks that I find quite delightful...just in case you ever want to get me a present ;)?
<li>Hydration</li> I am not good at this. In the summer, I bring water on runs of 1.5 hours and put 1 Nuun tablet in my bottle. I haven't figured out a way to avoid sloshing in the stomach. I have heard things about Tailwind. I will someday try it...maybe.
<li>Nutrition</li> Again, this is not my forte. I tend to carry a variety of random Honey Stinger products on runs over 1.5 hours. They range from disgusting to barely palatable, with the Ginseng gels and strawberry lemonade chews being on the more favorable end of that spectrum. Bananas are sort of okay, but I don't enjoy smelling like a banana for the entirety of my run. I have tried Muir Energy gels, which my stomach didn't like (maybe real food is just too real for my stomach). Spring Energy is on my list...once my Honey Stinger stash dwindles.
<li>Squirrel's Nut Butter</li> Chafing isn't a problem I normally deal with, but once every while for reasons I can't explain, it becomes one. This stuff works, and it's got an irresistibly cute logo too.
</ul>

I know far less about training etc. than I probably ought to, but it's a work in progress (also one very open to input)

<h2>building stuff</h2>

<h2>bread</h2>
Okay, so I might actually manage to sneak this one into research at some point, but I really like everything about bread. There are 3 things that capture what has enabled me to make a good loaf: patience, hydration, and temperature (related to patience). I err on the impatient side, so I have yet to over-proof or over-bake my bread. Doubling the time I think a loaf will take to rise has worked for me. Regarding hydration, I try to use whole-wheat flour in place of all-purpose when I can, which changes the amount of water I need in comparison to what a given recipe calls for. For a sandwich loaf, I aim for a dough that just barely comes clean from hands/the bowl. to Maybe I'm just a really bad judge of when bread is done without technology, but using a meat thermometer to help me determine when my baked goods are perfectly baked has been a total game changer for me.

<h2>cats</h2>
Possibly my favorite photography subject.
<!--Trying to adopt a cat? I've interacted with quite a few rescues and would highly recommend: Berkeley Humane, Maine Coon Adoptions, Love All Pawz,-->

<!--<h2>music</h2>
When I was in high school, I spent more time as a musician than I did as an academic student. I very rarely play anymore, but here are a few remnants from times past:

If you're in the Seattle area, I cannot recommend the following teachers enough:
<ul>
<li>Victoria Bogdashevskaya (piano)</li>
<li>Debra Zadinsky (violin)</li>
<li>Leonid Keylin (violin)</li>
</ul>-->
