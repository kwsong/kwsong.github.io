In the summer of 2010, I worked with Dr. Bob Street at <a href="https://www.parc.com/" target="_blank">Palo Alto Research Center</a> on a few projects related to understanding the physics of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells. In one project, we created an empirical model to understand how series resistance (e.g. from junctions between layers of the thin film stack) affects the solar cell's measured photocurrent, which is an important measure for deriving electronic properties and analyzing electron-hole recombination effects that affect the solar cell's overall performance. I also conducted low-level measurements of the photoconductivity spectral response of BHJ solar cells to better understand the cells' electronic structure and density of states.

My internship was funded by the <a href="https://environment.princeton.edu" taget="_blank">Princeton Environmental Institute</a>'s (now the High Meadows Environmental Institute) Energy Grand Challenges program, and solar cells used for our study were designed and fabricated by Dr. Sarah Cowan in <a href="https://heeger.cnsi.ucsb.edu">Professor Alan Heeger</a>'s lab at UC-Santa Barbara.
