During the Spring 2020 semester at Berkeley, I took <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS284A/" target="_blank">CS284A: Foundations of Computer Graphics</a>, a class covering the fundamentals of rendering across 5 projects in C++ and OpenGL (rasterization, mesh editing, path tracing, advanced path tracing, and cloth simulation) plus a group final project. Along with two Berkeley undergraduates, Jason Li and Alex Yang, I chose to render iridescent objects for my final project, which won an Honorable Mention for the semester's <a href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp20/article/39/final-project-showcase" target="_blank">Final Project Showcase</a>. Our final video and report are below.
