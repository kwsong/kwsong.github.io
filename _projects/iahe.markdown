During my senior year of college (2010-2011), I was the team captain for Princeton University's submission to the International Association for Hydrogen Energy's 1st Hydrogen Design Competition. Our task was to construct a solar-powered portable (< 1 cubic meter) hydrogen generator, with points awarded based on creativity, hydrogen generation rate, portability, safety, and cost. Our submission, "The Homemaker's Hydrogen Generator," won first place.
