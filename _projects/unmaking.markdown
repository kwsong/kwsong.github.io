Much of my work at Berkeley so far has been exploring new materials and 3D printing workflows for the design of an object's "unmaking" post-fabrication. Our first paper has been conditionally accepted for publication and presentation at CHI2021. The final manuscript is under preparation and will be shared soon! For now, here is our abstract:

The access and growing ubiquity of digital fabrication has ushered in a celebration of creativity and "making."  However, the focus is often on the resulting static artifact or the creative process and tools to design it. We envision a post-making process that extends past these final static objects – not just in their making but in their "unmaking."  By drawing from artistic movements such as Auto-Destructive Art, intentionally inverting well-established engineering principles of structurally sound designs, and safely misusing unstable materials, we demonstrate an important extension to making – unmaking.  In this paper, we provide designers with a new vocabulary of unmaking operations within standard 3D modeling tools. We demonstrate how such designs can be realized using a novel multi-material 3D printing process. Finally, we detail how unmaking allows designs to change over time, is an ally to sustainability and re-usability, and captures themes of "aura," emotionality, and personalization.
