Although neither of my parents are scientists or engineers, they both have PhDs, and as such, I think it's safe to say that I was biased from an early age to pursue a doctorate degree.

The summer after my freshman year (2008), I was fortunate enough to land a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at Carnegie Mellon. I unfortunately cannot recall the details of this application process, but old e-mails reveal that I applied to at least 10 programs and got acceptances at 3 (University of Washington's Genetically Engineered Materials Science and Engineering; University of Kansas Department of Chemical/Petroleum Engineering; Carnegie Mellon Department of Materials Science).

I left Princeton fully convinced that I wanted to be a professor, but I first needed to "get graduate school out of the way."

I even wrote a long e-mail to another graduate student in one of my old groups who was struggling with feelings that sounded too familiar.
